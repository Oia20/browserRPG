This project is an expansion on free code camp's RPG.
Github Pages website for this project: https://oia20.github.io/browserRPG/

The long term goal for this plan after more learning is to update this game to have a more engaging ui/ux, add features such as advanced inventory system, new mobs, and possibly even simple sprites with animations.

Technologies used:

- HTML
- CSS
- Vanilla JS

  
Problems faced/concepts learned:

- The use of objects. Whenever objects are used how they are in this program, it makes your life soooo much easier as you add features, and to use your object in a don't repeat yourself way.
- learned about math.random, transfering my knowledge of this function from python to js
- learned about math.floor
- my first exposure to query selectors.
